### Introduction
The project aims to predict hotel booking cancellations using a dataset with various features related to hotel bookings. Insights gained from this analysis can help hotel managers make informed decisions to improve booking rates and reduce cancellations.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Inspection of the dataset for anomalies and missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features for modeling.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summaries and data visualizations to understand booking trends and relationships between variables.
- Key findings on seasonal trends, impact of lead time on cancellations, and guest preferences.

### Predictive Modeling
- Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree models.
- Evaluation of model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Challenges faced with KNN due to dataset size and memory constraints.

### Handling Class Imbalance with SMOTE
- Application of SMOTE to balance the dataset.
- Analysis of the impact of SMOTE on model performance, with insights on overfitting and decision boundary complexity.

### Conclusions
- Summary of key insights and learnings from the project.
- Reflections on the importance of appropriate model and technique selection in data science.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- SMOTE (imblearn)
